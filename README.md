## 1. Project Description

This project studies the relationship between **students’ lifestyle habits**, **sleep behavior**, and **academic performance** using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

The objective is to quantify how behavioral factors such as **screen time**, **stress level**, and **caffeine consumption** influence **sleep duration** and **sleep quality**, and how these sleep-related variables, in turn, affect **academic performance**.

The project combines:
- Scientific literature
- Data simulation grounded in empirical evidence
- Regression-based machine learning models
- Quantitative evaluation and interpretation

## 2. Research Question

How do sleep duration and sleep quality influence academic performance among students, and how do behavioral factors such as stress, screen time, and caffeine intake affect this relationship?
