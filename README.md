# 💤 Dreams & Grades  
## 📊 Machine Learning Project – Introduction to Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course.  
It aims to analyze the impact of **students’ lifestyle habits**, **sleep behavior**, and sleep-related characteristics on **academic performance**, using statistical methods and machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Dreams & Grades** project investigates the relationships between:

- 🖥️ Screen time  
- ☕ Caffeine consumption  
- 😰 Stress level  

and their effects on:

- 🛌 Sleep duration  
- 🌙 Sleep quality  

as well as the indirect influence of sleep on **academic performance**.

The approach combines:
- scientific literature review,
- realistic data simulation,
- interpretable regression models,
- quantitative analysis and evaluation.

## 🎯 Research Question

> How do sleep duration and sleep quality influence students’ academic performance,  
> and how do behavioral factors such as stress, screen time, and caffeine consumption affect this relationship?
